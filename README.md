## 🎮 What Is the Dead Island 2 Trainer?

A trainer is an external program that injects real-time cheats into your game — with hotkeys, toggleable options, and a clean overlay menu. It doesn’t replace files or damage your game install. Instead, it runs side-by-side, letting you activate whatever hacks you need on the fly 🔧

This trainer works for **single-player only**, with full compatibility for both **Steam** and **Epic Games** versions.
